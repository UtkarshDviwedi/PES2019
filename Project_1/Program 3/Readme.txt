Project 1 Program 3

Question
 Given the starting integer value 0xCAFE, perform each of these operations in series,
 that is, each operation should be performed on the result of the previous function.
 1 Print the results of each function to the command line (to capture as ProgramThree.out).
 2 Print the original input in hexadecimal
 3 Test if 3 of last 4 bits are on, and print the value in binary (along with the result of the test – true/false)
 4 Reverse the byte order, print the value in hexadecimal
 5 Test if 3 of last 4 bits are on, and print the value in binary (along with the result of the test – true/false)
 6 Rotate the value by four bits to the left, print the value in hexadecimal
 7 Test if 3 of last 4 bits are on, and print the value in binary (along with the result of the test – true/false)
 8 Rotate the value by eight bits to the right, print the value in hexadecimal
 9 Test if 3 of last 4 bits are on, and print the value in binary (along with the result of the test – true/false)
